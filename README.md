# char-rnn-tweetbot
Building off of [xaroth8088/char-rnn](https://github.com/xaroth8088/char-rnn), create an extremely simple bot that tweets out things generated by the NN

# Building and Running
The included `Dockerfile` will create an image that will post a single tweet when run.  Perfect for adding to a Kubernetes cronjob!

## Adding model checkpoint files
After training your model in char-rnn, copy `char-rnn/data/<your model here>` into the `data/checkpoint-to-tweet-from` directory in this project.  For a smaller image, you can safely delete all checkpoint model data except the ones referenced in the `char-rnn/data/<your model here>/training_checkpoints/checkpoint` file.

## Configuring Twitter credentials
Edit the `edit-then-rename-to-config.ini` and input the relevant Twitter app credentials.  Then, rename this file to `config.ini`.
